`angular-shell` is an minimal setup for building Angular-powered front-end webapps.

Why another starting point for Angular? Because every existing one (Yeoman, angular-seed, etc) is **highly opinionated**.

Don't get me wrong, this one is opinionated too.

But it's my opinion.

### What this is

* a simple directory structure
* a very granular Gulpfile
* essential npm and bower dependencies

### What this is not

* a bunch of boilerplate code or snippets
* a framework on top of Angular
* a "scaffolding" tool


## To do

* clean up Gulpfile when gulp 4 comes out
* add testing setup
* reset.css
